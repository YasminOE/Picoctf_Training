# Python Wrangling

## Description
This project contains a Python script that needs to be run with a password to get the flag. The necessary files are included in this repository.

## Usage
To run the script locally, make sure you have Python and the `cryptography` module installed. You can then run the command ``python3 ende.py -d flag.txt.en``. Enter the password when prompted, and you will get the flag.
